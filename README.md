Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

This gem displays 5 star rating in a view. once you install this gem, you get a helper method called as "render_stars". All you need to do is pass a number or float inside this method as an argument and it will display the star rating image for you.

It will also round the rating so if you pass 2.21 as the rating it will display 2 stars.
